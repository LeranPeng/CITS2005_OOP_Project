## itertools
Iterators are a powerful tool in Object Oriented Programming. Java already
provides a simple iterator interface (java.util.Iterator), but it is possible to make
much more powerful and versatile iterators. The itertools package is a library of
tools for working with iterators. You have been asked to implement a number of
methods within itertools. You are permitted and expected to add your own new
.java source files within itertools as appropriate.
The itertools library provides the `DoubleEndedIterator<T>` interface, which
represents an iterator that can be consumed either from the front or the back, and
the `RangeIterator` class, as an example implementation of
`DoubleEndedIterator`.
A number of methods in this package use interfaces from Java's java.util.function
package, which represents different kinds of mathematical functions as objects so
we can pass them as arguments to methods. Example implementations of these
interfaces are included in the template source and tests.
